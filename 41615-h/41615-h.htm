<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h2>
<hr />

occurred during the past summer while the writer was spending his
vacation in a retired but charming part of the Catskill Mountains.</p>

<p>It was written for the amusement of the guests at <span class="smcap">Todd's</span> "Hillside
Home," to whom the facts as set forth were familiar, and who will

<div class="poemcontainer">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a little dog whose name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Tuffy Todd, who has the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wise look as many a dog you've met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is a well-bred house-dog pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quaintly called in rhyme a hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please the poet's ear for sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round as a mole, he's fat and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And robed in coat of whitest hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soft brown eyes are bright and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little ears are quick to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has a kind expressive face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every feature full of grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In disposition meek and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's gentle as a little child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But has his own peculiar way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all who hear will surely say.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 06]</span>
He is to people so polite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd think he'd never bark or bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strangers climbing up the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will shout in vain: "You hound, be still!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And traveler late in midnight dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sure to hear Tuff's loudest bark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While tramps who come about the yard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must flee or face a valiant guard.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Although he has a host of friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them he rarely condescends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their caresses kindly made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are with indifference coldly paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives for Master Orrin Todd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worships him as household god;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him Tuff wildly romps and plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his side but seldom strays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times when Orrin goes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tarry but a single day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bids his Tuffy stay behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And try to have a peaceful mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Tuff, so sad and desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies down alone to meditate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seeks the porch&mdash;a sunny place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 07]</span>
To watch for Todd's returning face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wait until the voice so dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fall like music on his ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved by other sight or sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lies as if in thought profound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call him, he seems both deaf and dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless you say: "Ho! <i>Orrin's</i> come!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When quick, like one from sleep, he springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flies, as swift as bird on wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet his master and his friend,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuffy's mourning has an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ways eccentric may appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the sequel they'll be clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now little Tuff, it may seem strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lived at home, nor thought of change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one calm morning clear and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if new visions filled his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>Griffin's Corners</i> begged a ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Orrin's wagon by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Master Todd could not deny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleading of poor Tuffy's eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "Jump in and take a seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you shall have a royal treat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 08]</span>
For though we go by mountain road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do not want a heavy load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our sprightly horses strong and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never mind a mite like you."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuff leaped in and sat erect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to show his intellect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When off they rode with hearts of glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warmer friends you rarely see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Orrin thought it would be nice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give his Tuffy some advice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be careful, Tuffy mine," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We go where many dangers be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn not aside nor leave my track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till setting sun shall warn us back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In town you will a stranger be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I say: Go not from me."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the simple dog replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, never will I leave thy side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But follow where thy footsteps lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dearest friend in time of need."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Our Tuff can talk like dogs of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom in fable Æsop told.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 09]</span>
Then Todd, to pass away the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus entertained his guest in rhyme:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've always made you stay at home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never let you widely roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I feared you might be lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the world be rudely tossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lest in some unlucky way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You might be hurt as on that day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That doleful, direful day,&mdash;when life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death seemed balanced in the strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You then were but a little pup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a snail could scarce keep up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seeing Flora's gentle pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You thought with her you'd run a race!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she moved along the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulled with care her heavy load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You chanced to fall beneath the wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which crushed your leg and made you reel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O dreadful sight! O fearful cry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mangled limb! no surgeon nigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stanched the blood which freely flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my arms&mdash;a tiny load&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bore you safely to our door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said: 'You shall go out no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 10]</span>
Until your leg is fully healed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or death shall take you from the field!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set and bandaged well your limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Should surgeon doubt, I'd challenge him,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid you on an easy bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw that you were kindly fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I closely watched you night and day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did not fail for you to pray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you had reached the third long week,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank God! (with reverence do I speak)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas plain you needed nothing more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than just to walk about the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, when people thought you dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You left your room and little bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He's <i>tough</i>," they said, "as hickory rod,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called you "<i>Tough</i>," then Tuffy Todd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus you see it strangely came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have a soft and pretty name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now since to perfect health restored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thank me well you can afford."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tuff answered: "Do you doubt, dear friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I shall thank you to the end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I was struck by wheel so rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 11]</span>
Have I not shown you gratitude?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I not always been to you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obedient, faithful, good and true?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through evil and through good report<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've never failed in my support!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaking friends, let none deny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you I've lived, for you I'll die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What care I for the world around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all my joy in you is found?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please pardon if too bold I seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hold me firm in your esteem."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I did not mean to grieve your heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Tuff, nor cause a single smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But just to have a little play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought I'd see what you would say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In answer to my sober talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While slow the horses onward walk."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Conversing thus as friend with friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last they reach their journey's end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Todd's heart with anxious fears beset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreboding peril to his pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turns to Tuffy: "You've been warned<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 12]</span>
In language clear and unadorned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay by me and to beware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dangers lurking everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although no prophet born or bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though on my mind no light is shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear from knowledge of your race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The day will end in your disgrace</i>."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out jumped brave Tuff and Farmer Todd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarce had gone a single rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they heard: "Bow-wow! Friend Tuff!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that's your name I'm sure enough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How glad I am to see your face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give to you a friend's embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now while in town, stay thou with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boon companions we will be."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuff, (poor "Innocent abroad,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never dreamed of any fraud,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied: "Perhaps we've met before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll take your word and ask no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would not seem polite, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I refuse with you to go."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away they marched, as large as life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts with hope and pleasure rife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 13]</span>
And wandered in their heedless play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through many a dark and devious way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked they raced and chased around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lawless cur and recreant hound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took no note of time, nor cared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How far they strayed nor how they fared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Tuff could not foresee his woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till darkness did around him close.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, Tuffy, born and reared in ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bread enough to eat and cheese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now thy master's tender care?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now the bed thou erst didst share?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy new-made friend all false will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time of thy adversity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the cold, cold ground to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sleep shall come ere morning light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor morsel sweet for hungry maw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor peace for nature's broken law!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The westering sun had low declined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When homeward with an easy mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Orrin turned his horses' feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expecting there his dog to meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 14]</span>
But drawing near, no Tuff was found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet him with accustomed sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Orrin could not sleep a wink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lay awake all night to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sad the fate of Tuff might be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who late was in prosperity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back, in the early morning bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Griffin's Orrin took his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thoughts of Tuff so filled his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other thought a place could find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he passed each neighbor's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas little known the load he bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dogs ran out and barked so bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wakened echoes in the wold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While ducks and geese joined in the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quacked and screamed for their dear life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then proudly crowed vain chanticleer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am, you see, without a peer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let none within my realm intrude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scare my hens and little brood."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But patient kine in farmyard pent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were mute with meek-eyed wonderment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 15]</span>
While grazing sheep on hillside near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard all and said: "We need not fear;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each mother called her own dear lamb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who answered back: "Oh, here I am!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The squirrel with his nimble feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now quickly found a safe retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the wall, or limb on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peeped slyly out as Todd went by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds from out the leafy trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gently swayed by morning breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth their notes in merry lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang: "Good speed and happy day!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And insect world, on joyous wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sunlight clear did sweetly sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hum in myriad tones so gay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We cheer the traveler on his way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ferns and flowers in wayside beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With meek surprise did lift their heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whisper low: "Our friend's in haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has no time on us to waste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In days gone by he'd stop awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To praise our charms and make us smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or take us in his gentle hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if rare gifts from foreign lands."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 16]</span>
And thus each loving, living thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kindly thought or word to bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which proved a balm to soothe Todd's soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he moved onward to his goal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The livelong day through street and lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought his dog, but sought in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From house to house he asked each man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where's Tuff? Pray tell me if you can."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, Tuff has gone with Bruno Brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog," they said, "of poor renown."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was enough to turn one's brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To always hear this sad refrain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Retracing now in twilight drear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His weary steps, Todd dropped a tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took with heavy heart the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His feet had pressed at opening day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walked in doubt and gloom along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where late he sang his cheerful song,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where frisked his faithful dog with glee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kept him joyful company.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor Tuff, a wanderer forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now loud bewailed that he was born!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 17]</span>
For though in darkness and in grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came no friend to his relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But being born he did not care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just then to die. With reason rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He searched along the dusty ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see where footprints could be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he with keen instinctive nose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discerned the course of Orrin's toes!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then light and hope began to rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheer the darkness of his skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While slow he kept the lonely road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which led him safe to his abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce twelve had struck the kitchen clock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo! was heard a scratch or knock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh!" said his wife: "Oh, Orrin dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The lost is found; our Tuff is here!</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up sprang Orrin with a bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcomed home his truant hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose downcast eye and trembling frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed a sense of guilt and shame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Todd in sweet forgiving mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread Tuff a couch and gave him food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 18]</span>
And bade him now find rest in sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus forget his sorrows deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuff in silence ate his meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But made by looks this sad appeal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh friend, in sorrow and in cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's none on earth as you so dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the trouble I have brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am not worthy of your thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would receive a just return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should you my presence coldly spurn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from me turn with angry frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me in despair sink down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not plead in self-defence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor try to prove my innocence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But truth requires that I should say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I was duped and led astray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cunning dog, who boldly claimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd seen my home ere I was named&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had heard of Tuffy Todd before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When passing by our cottage door!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led me captive at his will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made me suffer direst ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was no more than I deserved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from the path of duty swerved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 19]</span>
I have my sins and woes confessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask forgiveness, peace and rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh grant the mercy which I crave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I shall find an early grave!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To such petition all unused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faltering words and eyes suffused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind Orrin made this brief reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The same true friends are you and I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we have ever been before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will be now and evermore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since you mourn this first offence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deep and humble penitence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grant forgiveness full and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust no lapse again to see."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To banish care and doubt and fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waken hope and faith and cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Orrin, with a tact supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From great to small then changed his theme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My dog," quoth he, "with morning sun<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There comes just now this happy thought&mdash;<br /></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
